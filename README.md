# Co-Aux
[![Deploy to Amazon ECS](https://github.com/schen9981/co-aux/actions/workflows/aws.yml/badge.svg?event=deployment_status)](https://github.com/schen9981/co-aux/actions/workflows/aws.yml)

Co-Aux is a web application app that allows its users to collaborate and interact with others to create and manage unique music playlists as they are streaming (tentatively via Spotify). Music is present at nearly every moment of day to day life, from getting ready in the morning to commuting to work to hosting a party with friends. Co-Aux would make it easier for users to better match their playlists to the moment by allowing other users to provide input into what is playing.
